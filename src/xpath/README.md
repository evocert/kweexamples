This example illustrates using `Domino` along with `jQuery` and `XPathJS` to perform xpath queries. `./src/lib` contains relevant libraries. `./src/index.js` loads `Domino`, creates a `window` and makes available a `document`, loads in `jQuery`, populates the DOM, and then uses `XPathJS` to perform the xpath query.

The `Domino` window may also be initialized with an xml string, which can then be queried using `XPathJS`
